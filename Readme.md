# Basic OpenGL starter kit

This is not finished yet but it is intended to be a starter kit for students looking to use OpenGL on projects for University of Highlands and Islands.

## Getting started

Notes

* the dnf commands are for Fedora 32 and other commands may be required for other distributions.
* I am using the static libraries rather than dynamic libraries
* For Ubuntu dependencies you can copy and paste from the Dockerfile

```
sudo dnf -y install mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel zlib-devel
sudo dnf -y install libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel libXi-devel
sudo dnf -y install zlib-devel irrXML-devel
sudo dnf -y install doxygen graphviz
sudo dnf -y install cppcheck
sudo dnf -y install ccache
pip3 install --user conan
conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default

git clone https://github.com/tommccallum/opengl_test
./build.sh
./build/bin/opengl_test
```

## Docker

It is a straight forward build process for the docker instance.

Currently it crashes when run in the docker environment currently, still investigating.

```
docker build -t opengltest .
docker run -it --rm -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --privileged opengltest /bin/bash
```

To test the ability to show OpenGL within docker run ```glmark2```.

## Dependencies

* [The Open-Asset-Importer-Lib](https://www.assimp.org/)
* [GLAD is Multi-Language GL/GLES/EGL/GLX/WGL Loader-Generator based on the official specs.](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
* [GLM is OpenGL Mathematics](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)
* [STB is the Sean T Barrett C Library](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
* [GLFW is a multiplatform library for OpenGL and Vulkan](https://www.glfw.org/)
* [libXrandr-devel is required by GLFW used for X resize and rotate library](https://www.x.org/wiki/libraries/libxrandr/)
* [libxinerama]()
* [libXcursor-devel are the XCursor headers]()
* [libxi-devel are the XInput headers]()
* [GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew)

For OpenGL you need the following libraries:
```
sudo dnf -y install mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel
```

Assimp static libraries are:
```
./code/libassimp.a
```

Dependencies that need to be installed to get GLFW to compile:
```
sudo dnf -y install libXrandr-devel libxinerama-devel libXinerama-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel libXi-devel
```

## Digging in

* You can find out what commands are running in the build, by going to the build directory and running the following:

```
make VERBOSE=1
```

For debug mode you can specify the following argument to cmake when in the build directory:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

or type the following for build.sh:

```
./build.sh --debug
```

## Debug with gdb

```
gdb ./build/bin/opengltest
```

To set up with VS Code, setup a build task which calls build.sh and then a launch.json that points to the opengltest executable.


## Profiling

### Using GProf

In the CMakeFile.txt in the main application directory run on the option:

```
option(ENABLE_GPROF "Enable profiling using GPROF" ON)
```

Then you can build and run the following:

```
gprof ./build/bin/opengltest > run.stats
```
