# Basic OpenGL starter kit

This is not finished yet but it is intended to be a starter kit for students looking to use OpenGL on projects for University of Highlands and Islands.

## Getting started

Notes

* the dnf commands are for Fedora 32 and other commands may be required for other distributions.
* I am using the static libraries rather than dynamic libraries
* For Ubuntu dependencies you can copy and paste from the Dockerfile

```
sudo dnf -y install mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel zlib-devel
sudo dnf -y install libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel libXi-devel
sudo dnf -y install zlib-devel irrXML-devel

git clone https://github.com/tommccallum/opengl_test
./build.sh
cd build
./opengl_test
```

## Docker

It is a straight forward build process for the docker instance.

Currently it crashes when run in the docker environment currently, still investigating.

```
docker build .
docker run -ti <CHECKSUM> /bin/bash
```

## Dependencies

* [The Open-Asset-Importer-Lib](https://www.assimp.org/)
* [GLAD is Multi-Language GL/GLES/EGL/GLX/WGL Loader-Generator based on the official specs.](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
* [GLM is OpenGL Mathematics](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)
* [STB is the Sean T Barrett C Library](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
* [GLFW is a multiplatform library for OpenGL and Vulkan](https://www.glfw.org/)
* [libXrandr-devel is required by GLFW used for X resize and rotate library](https://www.x.org/wiki/libraries/libxrandr/)
* [libxinerama]()
* [libXcursor-devel are the XCursor headers]()
* [libxi-devel are the XInput headers]()

For OpenGL you need the following libraries:
```
sudo dnf -y install mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel
```

Assimp static libraries are:
```
./code/libassimp.a
```

Dependencies that need to be installed to get GLFW to compile:
```
sudo dnf -y install libXrandr-devel libxinerama-devel libXinerama-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel libXi-devel
```
